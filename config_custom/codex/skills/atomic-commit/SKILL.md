# Atomic Commit

## Goal

Produce a clean, typed commit that matches the change set.

## Workflow

1. Confirm repository state:
	- `git status`
	- `git diff HEAD`
	- `git status --porcelain`
2. Review changed and untracked files and ensure they belong to one coherent commit.
3. Stage files required by the task.
4. Create one atomic commit with prefix tag such as:
	- `feat: ...`
	- `fix: ...`
	- `docs: ...`
	- `refactor: ...`
	- `test: ...`
	- `chore: ...`

## Guardrails

- If repository is not initialized, report that commit cannot be created.
- If changes are mixed and non-atomic, split by intent before committing.
- Do not use interactive git modes.
